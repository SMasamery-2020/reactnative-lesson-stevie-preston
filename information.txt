Element: 
 1) Arrays

Array:
  Arrays are used to store multiple types (no maximum value) of values, being strings, int, float, or variable.
  
  Syntax:
    arrayName: ['string', 1, 'string2', 50]
  
  Arrays can be used to store values that can be called through *indexing*.
  
  Indexing allows for accessing different values through the syntax:
    arrayName[indexValue]
  So in this case, to access 'string' you will use the syntax:
    arrayName[0]
  
  Tip: Indexing always starts with 0, then goes up by one.
  
  You can use operations and conditions to make arrays even more accessable.
  
Example:
  Let's say you are making a friends list or want to keep track of your friends.
  You can make a list named 'friends':
    friends: []
  Then within the friends list you can add names:
    friends: ['Darcey','Mark','Lucy']
  Now that you have their names, what if you want to get their age.
  Create an age list named 'age':
    age: []
  Within age, you can your friend's ages:
    age: [15,16,16]
  
  To show the list value on screen you create a Text Element with the following code:
    <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
        {this.state.friends[0]}
    </Text>
  This will display Darcey.
  Then if you want to display their age as well you create another Text Element:
    <Text stlye={styles.paragraph}>
        {this.state.age[0]
    </Text>
  This will print 15.
